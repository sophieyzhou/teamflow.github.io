##  About Team Flow

Team Flow is a biomedical engineering project team at the University of Michigan focused on improving patient safety in low-resource hospital settings. We are designing a **low-cost medical device** to reduce IV infusion misadministrations using a **simple, light-based tracking system**.

We partner with:
- The University of Michigan (College of Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Center for Entrepreneurship)

We are a passionate group of undergraduate and master's students from engineering, biological sciences, and business.
