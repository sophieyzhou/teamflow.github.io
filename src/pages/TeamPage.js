    <div className="content">
      <h1>Our Team</h1>
      <p>
        Placeholder with Ideas before Sophie gets it together and prettifies
      </p>
      <p>
        Take heavy inspiration from the BOND team page
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally have banners with Leadership, and subteam pictures on the banners. Actually maybe not because then there will be awkward spaces. Idk
      </p>
      <p>
        I like the straightforward cards and the sizing/spacing that BOND uses. 
        One card per person with their position and name written under the card. 
        Embed links to their linkedin when you click the name? or picture? Note: Force everyone to make linkedin
        I kind of want the cards to flip over when you hover and have a 1-2 sentence intro like year name time on team and interests? Maybe. Idk. Look at pheonix's website too
        OR have the cards fade gray and linkedin pop up like BOND has
      </p>
      <h1>Placement</h1>
      <p>
        Fuck yea imma brag and throw up as many logos as I possibly can here hehe. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Do it animation style with things on a time loop fading in and out or sliding across. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything goes: Wayne Med, BCG, Lilly, P&G, Boston Scientific, Stryker, Bauer or where Sam did the infusion pump shit, Goodnotes?, NIH, stalk other alum
